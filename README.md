## Well, i am Aevyx.
i'm a developer (i think so), a cse student and a full-time enthusiast of things i barely understand.

### Talk with me
i'm usually haunting the digital space. You'll mostly find me lurking on my personals:
* **Site:** [https://metaversemagician.space](https://metaversemagician.space)
* **Fedi Instance:**  [https://quasar.metaversemagician.space](https://quasar.metaversemagician.space)

there are more places but their domain changes from time to time...so i am not linking them here...

### 📜 A Very very very very very important note
i hate the uppercase 'i' letter. be warned. i also prefer directness over pointless greetings - if you have a point, make it. if it's paid work, i reply faster.
